# Verity üß™

Verity is an advanced ZK (Zero-Knowledge) and MPC (Multi-Party Computation) cryptography framework and network designed to maximise user trust and mitigate data security risks in sourcing and processing ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù data. This includes private, niche, or custom data in systems and APIs beyond blockchains. Verity ensures verifiable and privacy-preserving transparency in data flow, sources, security, and processing.

_Think of it as a way to observe and verify [data lineage](https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lineage)._

## Overview

Verity üß™ secures data pipelines between the real world and blockchain, ensuring transparency and verification of data lineage. Data lineage refers to the flow of data as it transitions from a source to a destination.

With Verity, sovereign blockchains and data-driven protocols can verify:

1. **Data Authenticity**: Ensure and incentivise data sourced from highly trusted entities.
2. **Data Integrity**: Embed tamper-resistance to prevent bad data from being incorporated into the data pipeline and to prevent unauthorised data manipulation.
3. **Data Transformation**: Advance data through state transitions to create compatibility for various destination systems in an expected and trust-minimised manner.

This removes the need for users to trust you in order to trust the outcomes of the data.

## Benefits

1. **Access to Private Data**:

   Verity allows access to private data gated by API keys, which can be redacted in these proofs. Examples include government and health-related systems, or public gated APIs such as esports results and blockchain RPC endpoints.

2. **Offchain Data Requests**:

   Unlike traditional Oracle networks, Verity moves data requests and cryptography offchain, reducing error handling risk and computational load on blockchains. Proofs are portable; external data is requested offchain and verified onchain.

3. **High-Frequency Data Provisioning**:

   Verity supports high-frequency data fetching and provisioning since data is requested offchain and proofs are generated asynchronously.

4. **Cost Efficiencies**:

   Verity offers cost efficiencies for data providers by allowing for filters and other offchain logic over external data. As long as the original authentic data is processed verifiably within the Verity platform, it can be securely verified onchain.

## Application

### **Truflation**

[Truflation](https://truflation.com/) is evolving into a decentralised data warehouse, aiming to maximise the quality of data used to produce indexes for virtually anything. Verity is tailored to allow this network to verify the integrity and authenticity of data sources, highlight new data sources enabled by open participants, and facilitate reputation and data quality control mechanisms for network security and value.

### **Blck IoT**

DePINs, such as [Blck IoT](https://blck-iot.com/), harness sensor data to enable verifiable data-driven reports for green initiatives and carbon offset certifications. Through Verity, Blck IoT aims to maintain sensor data privacy while irrefutably proving its role in facilitating sensor data delivery.

### **ChainSight**

An incumbent Oracle within the Internet Computer, [ChainSight](https://chainsight.network/) aims to combine verifiable data lineage and verifiable computation into unique and tailored data feeds based on data from virtually any source.

### **Stellar Anchors**

[Anchors](https://stellar.org/ecosystem?query=Usher%20Labs) act as bridges between the real world and the Stellar Blockchain, facilitating cross-border payments and foreign exchange services. However, each Anchor is currently relying on traditional expensive audits to deliver their value proposition. Verity aims to reduce these costs through automated self-attestation.

## Getting Started

To get started with Verity, please reach out to the Usher Labs team through our [Discord server](https://go.usher.so/discord) or our [direct contact page](https://usher.so/contact). We are actively collaborating with blockchain applications and Web3 teams to ensure the security of data, trust, and network operations. Our focus is on securing digital assets, both custodial and non-custodial, and maximizing user trust in outcomes by minimizing trust in data and pipelines between the real-world and blockchains.
