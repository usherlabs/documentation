# Cryptography

Verity employs the MPC-TLS primitive to create authenticity and integrity proofs for TLS/API requests. This allows a **Prover** to prove the source of their data and ensure it has not been tampered with.

In a typical HTTP request, a cryptographic (TLS) handshake occurs between the requestor and the responder server. The MPC-TLS primitive leverages standard TLS cryptography, enabling the server hosting the API to remain agnostic to this specific type of TLS request. This approach allows many existing API-powered services to become cryptographically provable.

To facilitate the MPC exchange, the requestor involves a third-party **Notary** in the socket connection. This allows the Notary to independently receive packets and perform authenticity checks on the data exchange between the original parties, co-signing the TLS handshake. The key advantage of this cryptographic engagement is that the Notary remains completely blind to the core data within the TLS request and response.

Verity leverages a fork of the open-source [TLSNotary Protocol](https://mirror.xyz/privacy-scaling-explorations.eth/T4MR2PgBzBmN2I3dhDJpILXkQsqZp1Bp8GSm_Oo3Vnw). By default, this protocol assumes that the Prover and Notary are non-collusive. Verity addresses this limitation through collusion prevention and integrity verification facilitated by **Verifiers**. Instead of directly involving a Notary, **Provers** first receive instructions from **Verifiers** specifying the authorised Notary. **Verifiers** then cross-reference signals from both parties to ensure integrity verification, resulting in secure proof of data sources.

TLSNotaryâ€™s proofs are not portable by default, meaning they cannot be verified across various blockchains and verifiable compute environments. Verity resolves this by breaking down TLS proofs into sub-proofs, enabling multi-party verification. This approach is crucial for allowing ZK and decentralised co-processors to verify proofs of data sources, facilitating subsequent verifiable data processing and integration into various blockchains.

In summary, Verity provides transparency in data lineage and end-to-end verified data pipelines. It can be enabled as an extension of any blockchain to serve various communities and ecosystems. Verity will launch with a general-purpose core Verifier set to deliver this value across numerous blockchain applications.
