# Quick Start Guide

The Log Store Network is a data availability platform for high-frequency time-indexed cryptographic attestations.
In essence, it can be thought of as a decentralized, time-series database.
It is designed to collect real-time signed metrics and attestations about things occurring off-chain and in the real-world.
The Log Store is developed on top of the Streamr Network, a peer-to-peer pub/sub data transport layer.
As such, data is published to the Log Store by registering streams are registered in the Log Store Network's Smart Contracts.

In this guide, we'll describe how to:

1. Create a stream.
2. Funding your Stores & Queries.
3. Store real-time data to in the network.
4. Query from the network

We will elaborate on all the steps listed above in the coming paragraphs.

## Installing the CLI Tool and JavaScript Client

In order to perform the key actions listed above, we will need to interact with the Log Store network and Interacting with the Log Store can be done via three major channels :- The CLI tool, the Javascript Client and the solidity smart contracts

**CLI →** More information on installing the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.logstore.usher.so/network/cli/getting-started), but it can be installed by running `npm i -g @logsn/cli` and is used for interacting with the Log Store network via the command line.

**Client/SDK →** More information on installing the JavaScript client/SDK can be found [here](https://docs.logstore.usher.so/network/sdk/getting-started), but it can be installed by running `npm i @logsn/client` and is used for interacting with the Log Store network from a JavaScript program.

**Contracts ->** The contracts are deployed on the polygon network, and the code, address and ABI can be found [here](https://github.com/usherlabs/logstore/tree/master/packages/contracts), and it can be instantiated for use using ethers.js or [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

### Configure the CLI

Configure your RPC Endpoint using

1. `logstore init`
2. Edit your configuration file at `~/.logstore-cli/default.json`

Otherwise you will need to pass the `--host` and `--wallet` flags.

## Creating a Stream

Before you can store data on the network or query data from the network, you must first create a stream, and this can be done in three different ways.

1. via the CLI: A stream can be created using the Log Store CLI tool via the following command:

```shell
logstore create-stream ${streamId} --host [https://polygon-rpc.com](https://polygon-rpc.com/) --wallet ${privateKey}
```

2. via the [Streamr Client](https://docs.streamr.network/usage/streams/creating-streams)

3. via the Streamr UI: The URL to the UI can be found [here](https://streamr.network/hub/streams/new). Fill in the name of the stream and submit the details.

## Funding your Stores & Queries

The **LSAN** token is the native token of the Log Store's Alpha Network. To learn more about this, visit [AlphaNet](../overview/alphanet.md)
To obtain this token is to reach out to the admins and developers for some test tokens on [discord](https://go.usher.so/discord).

## Publishing

Before you can publish to an already created stream, you need to stake some LSAN tokens, and this can be done both via the CLI tool and the Client.

Using the following methods, one can stake some LSAN tokens.

**CLI:**
Using the CLI tool installed earlier, we can specify a `streamId`, a `stakeAmount` and a `privateKey` in order to stake a certain amount of LSAN tokens to the network.

```shell
logstore store stake ${streamId} ${stakeAmount} --host https://polygon-rpc.com/ --wallet ${privateKey}
```

**Client:**

```javascript
import { StreamrClient } from "streamr-client";
import { LogStoreClient } from "@logsn/client";

const privateKey = "privateKey";
const streamId = "0xpublic_key/path/identifier";
const stakeAmount = 10000;

(function createStore(){
	// Initialize the LogStore client
	const streamrClient = new StreamrClient({
		auth: {
			privateKey,
		},
	})
	const logStoreClient = new LogStoreClient(streamrClient);

	// Get the stream
	const stream = await streamrClient.getStream(streamId);
	console.log({ stream });

	// Stake to the stream
	const stakeAmount = 10;
	const response = await logStoreClient.stakeOrCreateStore(
	   stream.id,
	   stakeAmount
	);

})();
```

Then, we can proceed to publish data to the stream.
To learn how to do this, please view [Streamr Documentation on Publishing](https://docs.streamr.network/usage/streams/publishing).

## Querying

Before you can query from a stream, you need to stake some LSAN tokens to the network, a query stake different from the stake earlier for storage of the data of a particular stream to the network.

Using the following methods, one can stake some LSAN tokens to the network for the purpose of performing a query.

**CLI:**
By specifying a wallet address and an amount to stake we can successfully stake for the purpose of querying from the network. You might notice we do not specify a stream, that is because you can query from any stream after this stake.

```shell
logstore query stake --host https://polygon-rpc.com/ --wallet ${walletAddress} ${amount}
```

**Client:**

```javascript
import { StreamrClient } from "streamr-client";
import { LogStoreClient } from "@logsn/client";

const streamId = "0xpublic_key/path/identifier";
const stakeAmount = 10000;

(function queryStake(){
	// Initialize the Log Store client
	const streamrClient = new StreamrClient({
		auth: {
			privateKey,
		},
	})
	const logStoreClient = new LogStoreClient(streamrClient);

	// Stake to the stream
	const stakeAmount = 10;
	const response = await logStoreClient.queryStake(
	   stakeAmount
	);
})();
```

Then, we can proceed to query data to the stream.

```javascript
import { StreamrClient } from "streamr-client";
import { LogStoreClient } from "@logsn/client";

const privateKey = "privateKey";
const streamId = "0xpublic_key/path/identifier";

(function queryStream(){
	// Initialize the Log Store client
	const streamrClient = new StreamrClient({
		auth: {
			privateKey,
		},
	})
	const logStoreClient = new LogStoreClient(streamrClient);

	const stream = await streamrClient.getStream(streamId);

	const query = await logStoreClient.query(
	    stream.id,
	    {
	      // Should see the recently sent messages, along with 3 identical ones from storage
	      last: 6,
	    },
	    (message) => {
      // Do something with the messages as they are received
      console.log(JSON.stringify(message));
    }
  );
})();
```

## Schema Validation

The Log Store also supports a schema validation feature. This enables automatic validation of streaming data against defined schemas, ensuring that only data conforming to these schemas is stored.

For a comprehensive understanding of this feature, including how to use it on your stream, please refer to the detailed section in our SDK documentation on [Schema Validation](/network/sdk/schema.md).
