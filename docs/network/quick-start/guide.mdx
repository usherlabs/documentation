# Quick Start Guide

The Log Store Network is a platform for data availability, specializing in high-frequency, time-indexed cryptographic attestations, effectively serving as a decentralized, time-series database.
Built atop the Streamr Network, it facilitates the collection of real-time signed metrics and attestations from both off-chain and real-world occurrences through a peer-to-peer data transport layer.

This guide will walk you through:

1. Creating a stream.
2. Funding your Stores & Queries.
3. Storing real-time data.
4. Querying the network.

### Installation

**CLI Tool & JavaScript Client:** Begin by installing our CLI tool and JavaScript client to interact with the Log Store Network.
The CLI tool, suitable for command-line interactions, can be installed with:

```shell
npm i -g @logsn/cli
```

For programmatic access, the JavaScript Client/SDK is available via:

```shell
npm i @logsn/client
```

Additionally, our smart contracts are accessible on the Polygon Network, with details available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/usherlabs/logstore/tree/master/packages/contracts).

### Configuration

Configure the CLI tool by initializing it with `logstore init` and editing the `~/.logstore-cli/default.json` file.
Alternatively, use the `--host` and `--wallet` flags for direct configuration.

## Creating a Stream

A stream must be created before data storage or querying can occur. This can be achieved through the CLI, Streamr Client, or Streamr UI.

- CLI Example:

  ```shell
  logstore create-stream ${streamId} --host https://polygon-rpc.com/ --wallet ${privateKey}
  ```

- [Streamr Client →](https://docs.streamr.network/usage/streams/creating-streams)
- [Streamr UI →](https://streamr.network/hub/streams/new)
- Streamr UI Demo:

  <LoomVideo
  	src={`https://www.loom.com/embed/1cb8e1d179304a12b5bb99164ebe2c97`}
  	hideOwner
  	hideTitle
  />

## Funding Stores & Queries

The Log Store Network is an Alpha, and therefore uses **LSAN** tokens for its operations. The [AlphaNet](../overview/alphanet.md) explains this in detail.
Obtain test tokens via our [Discord](https://go.usher.so/discord) and/or learn about [minting **LSAN**](../cli/mint-lsan.md).

## Publishing Data

After obtaining **LSAN** tokens, you can publish data to your stream.
This requires prior staking of **LSAN** tokens, which can be done using both the CLI tool and the Client.

**CLI Example:**

```shell
logstore store stake ${streamId} ${stakeAmountInWei} --host https://polygon-rpc.com/ --wallet ${privateKey}
```

**Client Example:**

```javascript
import { StreamrClient } from "streamr-client";
import { LogStoreClient } from "@logsn/client";

const privateKey = "privateKey";
const streamId = "0xpublic_key/path/identifier";
const stakeAmount = 10000;

(async (){
	// Initialize the LogStore client
	const streamrClient = new StreamrClient({
		auth: {
			privateKey,
		},
	})
	const logStoreClient = new LogStoreClient(streamrClient);

	// Get the stream
	const stream = await streamrClient.getStream(streamId);

	// Stake to the stream
	const stakeAmount = 10;
	const response = await logStoreClient.stakeOrCreateStore(
	   stream.id,
	   stakeAmount
	);

	// Publish messages to this stream
	await streamrClient.publish(
		stream.id,
		{
			hello: 'world',
		}
	);
})();
```

## Querying Data

Similar to publishing, querying data from a stream requires staking **LSAN** tokens, with the ability to query any stream post-stake.

**CLI Example:**

```shell
logstore query stake --host https://polygon-rpc.com/ --wallet ${privateKey} ${amountInWei}
```

**Client Example:**

```javascript
import { StreamrClient } from "streamr-client";
import { LogStoreClient } from "@logsn/client";

const streamId = "0xpublic_key/path/identifier";
const stakeAmount = 10000;

(async (){
	// Initialize the Log Store client
	const streamrClient = new StreamrClient({
		auth: {
			privateKey,
		},
	})
	const logStoreClient = new LogStoreClient(streamrClient);

	// Stake to the stream
	const stakeAmount = 10;
	const response = await logStoreClient.queryStake(
	   stakeAmount
	);

	// Query from the stream
	const query = await logStoreClient.query(
	    streamId,
	    {
	      // Should see the recently sent messages, along with 3 identical ones from storage
	      last: 6,
	    },
	    (message) => {
      // Do something with the messages as they are received
      console.log(JSON.stringify(message));
    }
  );
})();
```

## Schema Validation

The Log Store also supports a schema validation feature. This enables automatic validation of streaming data against defined schemas, ensuring that only data conforming to these schemas is stored.

For a comprehensive understanding of this feature, including how to use it on your stream, please refer to the detailed section in our SDK documentation on [Schema Validation](/network/sdk/schema.md).
