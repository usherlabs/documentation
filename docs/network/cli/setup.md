The CLI accepts both the `-h, --host` and `-w, --wallet` options within each CLI command.

However, a configuration file can be used to **set these values once**.

To create your configuration:

```shell
logstore init -w wallet_private_key -h polygon_rpc_endpoint
```

When executing a command, you can override the configuration file by passing the `-h, --host` and `-w, --wallet` options.
