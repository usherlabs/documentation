# Overview

AlphaNet is an integral part of the release of the Log Store Network. It serves as a initial testbed for Log Store's decentralized data storage and retrieval solution, while also remaining compatible with the Streamr Network’s live pub/sub topics (streams), managed within the Polygon Blockchain's MainNet, and Arweave’s live storage environment.

### Getting Started with AlphaNet

To interact with AlphaNet, you will need to follow a simple set of instructions. First, you must acquire **LSAN** tokens — a custom token developed exclusively for the Log Store AlphaNet. These tokens facilitate transactions within the network and can be obtained by depositing **MATIC** into the Log Store AlphaNet ERC20 Smart Contract.

### Roadmap to BetaNet & MainNet

AlphaNet is a stepping stone toward the full deployment of the Log Store Network.

As we transition from AlphaNet to BetaNet and eventually to MainNet, the LSAN tokens will play a crucial role. These tokens will eventually be replaced with a completely trustless counterpart, paving the way for deploying a new set of Smart Contracts powered by a token with production-grade tokenomics.

### Participation and Community Engagement

Your participation is vital to the success and improvement of AlphaNet. We encourage you to use the network, share your experiences, report bugs, and help us make it better. Stay connected with our team and other users through Discord and Twitter channels. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable as we continue developing and improving our services.

By using AlphaNet responsibly and proactively, you contribute to the creation of a robust, efficient, and secure decentralized event/atomic data storage and retrieval ecosystem.
