# Overview

The Log Store Network is decentralised data storage, access, and delivery for real-time streaming data. Capture, verify, and trace activity across a network, or various devices, applications, and/or software systems.

_Think of it as [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) with persistent identifiers for real-time data streams._

For an in-depth understanding of the network, research and technology, please refer to our **[Research](../../../research.md)**.

## Features

**Data Availability**: Built with deep integration and support for [the Streamr Network](https://streamr.network/), the Log Store is the best data availability layer for real-time data. This includes high-frequency data in DePINs, data produced by IoT devices and sensors, video and media streaming platforms, and more.

**Traceability**: Every message captured by the Log Store can be traced to a particular publisher, often identified by a public wallet.

**Ordered and Identifiable**: Messages are ordered by time relative to the identifier of the data stream. Identifiers are either inherited, as in the case of capturing Streamr data, or assigned by the operator exposing their local real-time data input through the decentralised message store.

**Input Versatility**: The Log Store can evolve to support many types of inputs. The Streamr Network is the first. Upcoming inputs include socket connections that offer real-time data capture within a private distributed cloud and an input to enable the Log Store as a data availability layer for IoTeX’s W3bStream. Usher Labs’ deep involvement with partner projects ensures that any new input can be requested for integration.

**Blockchain Integration**: Atomic events, messages, and metrics can be streamed in real-time to a decentralised database, serving as a cache so that Oracles, Blockchains, and other decentralised systems, which are fundamentally batch-based processes, can poll and query the database within a time range. The outcome is packet loss prevention, eventual data synchronicity, and trust-minimised integration of real-time data with any decentralised system.

## Outcomes

- **DePINs**: Log Store supports decentralising trust in DePINs’ data storage.

- **Shared Observability**: The Log Store Network helps facilitate a single source of truth for atomic events such as telemetry, metrics, and more. By decentralising trust in observability metrics, the network fosters open analysis of Web3 infrastructure.

- **Video & Media Delivery**: The Log Store Network can be utilised as a decentralised CDN for streaming data. Its ability to inconsistently distribute data caching and aggregate data at the point of query establishes it as a rapidly innovative platform for video and media data delivery.

- **Web3 Apps**: Capture traceable events across end-user applications on Web, Mobile, and in-game to create secure, gasless, trust-minimised onchain outcomes.

:::note
The Log Store Network is finding its place. By highlighting the core protocol and the value of this technology, Usher Labs is prepared for partnerships that adopt the protocol for various implementations, even where the entire network is not fully adopted.

## AlphaNet: The first release of the Network

We're thrilled to introduce AlphaNet, the first release of the Log Store Network which uses its own token, **LSAN** — necessary to enable compatibility with MainNet environments, while giving us the control we need to ensure secure operation of our early alpha software. Stay tuned for updates, and check out the **[AlphaNet](./alphanet.md)** section for more details.

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? By following these steps you’ll be able to participate in our network, store data, and query data:

1. **Mint LSAN Tokens**: LSAN tokens are the fundamental fuel that powers the capabilities of Log Store. Start by minting your tokens with **MATIC**.
2. **Stake LSAN Tokens**: Fund the network by staking your LSAN tokens. This staking allows you to store or query data. We use dynamic pricing to ensure fair compensation to the network based on the data services you utilize.
3. **Store and Query Data**: Use our interfaces to store and query data as per your application's needs.

### Interfaces

Our detailed documentation on SDK, CLI, and API is designed to guide you every step of the way:

- **SDK**: With our SDK, you can seamlessly integrate Log Store's capabilities into your software application. You can stake tokens and also store and query data using it.<br/>
  [Learn more →](../sdk/getting-started.md)
- **CLI**: The Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool lets you mint and stake LSAN tokens from your terminal.<br/>
