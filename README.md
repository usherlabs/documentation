# ðŸ“– **Welcome to Log Store Documentation repository**

This is the home of the Log Store documentation repository!

This website is built using **[Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/)**, a static website generator.

# Get started

## Installation

```sh
$ pnpm i

```

## Local Development

```sh
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

# **Customization**

## Creating and organizing content

- Store content in the `docs` directory, supporting `.md` and `.mdx` files. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc)
- Configure each folder metadata accordingly, using`_category_.json` or `_category_.yml`. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata)
- Utilize frontmatter options for configuration and customization. **[See the API here â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter)**
- Set a specific page as the main page [link] (if you do not intend to create a dedicated homepage. Otherwise, to create a homepage learn more here)
- Configure header navigation items in the `docusaurus.config.js` file. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-multi-instance#docs-navbar-items)
- Create multiple sidebars by updating `sidebars.js` according to your docs folder structure. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/multiple-sidebars)

**Example of a tree structure in the `docs` folder:**

```
docs
â”œâ”€â”€ getting-started
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ introduction.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ installation.md
â””â”€â”€ guides
    â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.md
    â””â”€â”€ customization.md

```

**Using the autogenerated sidebar:**

```js
module.exports = {
	sidebars: {
		gettingStarted: [
			{
				type: 'autogenerated',
				dirName: 'getting-started',
			},
		],
		guides: [
			{
				type: 'autogenerated',
				dirName: 'guides',
			},
		],
	},
};
```

This will generate separate sidebars for the `getting-started` and `guides` folders. Adjust the header navigation items in `docusaurus.config.js` accordingly.

Ensure you update both the `sidebars.js` file and the header navigation items in `docusaurus.config.js` when changing the documentation structure, providing a seamless navigation experience for users.

## Customization

### Basic customization

- Change fonts following instructions at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Modify typography settings at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Update colors at `tailwind.config.ts`

### Advanced customization

- Apply component-specific styles at specific `module.css` files
- Use mdx and React. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react)
- Swizzle built-in components or update our modifications at `src/theme/*` files. [Learn more about Swizzling â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling)
- Develop custom React pages at `src/pages`. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-react-page)

# Best practices

- When swizzling components, add comments to indicate where changes occurred
- Follow Docusaurus-specific best practices for versioning and customization. [Learn more â†’](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning#recommended-practices)

# Deployment

## Build

```sh
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Documentation d**eployment guidelines**

To deploy your documentation with Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a **[Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)** if you don't have one.
2. Install the **[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)** by running `npm i -g vercel`.
3. Run `vercel login` in your terminal and log in using your Vercel account.
4. In your project directory, run `vercel` to initiate the deployment process. Follow the prompts to link your project to Vercel.
5. Once your project is linked, Vercel will deploy your documentation. After the deployment, you'll receive a URL to access your live documentation.

For subsequent deployments, run `vercel --prod` in your project directory to deploy your documentation to the production environment.

For more information on Vercel deployments, consult the **[official Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)**.
